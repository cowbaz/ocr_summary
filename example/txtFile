Exit A of Woodleigh station
with the developing Bidadari
Estate

Woodleigh MAT station is an underground Mass Rapid Transit station on the North East line in Bidadari,
Singapore. The station is underneath Upper Serangoon Road, near the junction with Upper Aljunied Road.
Surrounding points of interest include Stamford American International School and Avon Park. The station
also serves the developing Bidadari Estate and Woodleigh Residences (pictured). Woodleigh was among
the 16 North East line stations first announced in March 1996. Despite being completed along with the rest
of the line in June 2003, the station remained closed due to the lack of local development. It eventually
opened on 20 June 2011. As with most of the North East line stations, it is a designated Civil Defence
shelter. Woodleigh station features an Art-in-Transit public artwork Siow Motion by April Ng on thirty zinc
panels, depicting commuters going about their daily lives. (Full article...)
